#Changes Since Last Group Meeting

## 23 October 2020

Main branch:
* Changed columns in detailed results column. Less redundant columns, moved confidence intervals
* Split Null models from empirical calibration to per database and added table
 that shows null distributions which are selectable
* Expanded bounds of calibration plot - however shaded area changes need to be submitted in a 
patch to the EmpiricalCalibration package
* Selectable calibrated/not calibrated values visible in forest plot

Branch for improved mappings:
* Added central REWARD-B cohort identifiers for all cohorts, regardless of source, auto incrementing
