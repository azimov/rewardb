Calibration of results is performed using the EmpiricalCalibration R package.
This attempts to correct the observed p-values and confidence internals by using a null distribution based on those
observed in negative controls, which are drug-diseases pairs are thought to have no relation to one another.
In this context, it is assumed that the true effect size of negative controls is one, and any further effect is a result
of bias.

Negative controls for REWARD-B are selected with an automated method that uses the Common Evidence Model (CEM).
Here, a valid negative control is selected if there is no literature, medication label indication or spontaneous reporting
that suggests there is increase or decreased risk to the exposed population.
